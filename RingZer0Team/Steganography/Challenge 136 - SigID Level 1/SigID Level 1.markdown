When you listen to the file, you can hear some noises that means it has something in it so we must use a frequency shower application.
I'd used Sonic Visualizer for it. If you add a spectogram layer to it, you can see an aztec code(1 in image) and a morse code(2 in image) in it.
grab the aztec code and change threshold and then simply scan it with a barcode scanner (remember to check that if the scanner could scan aztecs). The resualt is mathsRulesTheUniverse and this is the flag. Hooray :)
As I said, it contains a morse code that code help in SigID Level 2
