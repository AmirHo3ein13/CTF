This message and the key given to us looks like "one-time pad" encryption method. As you can see, the key is 6 character less than the message(without numbers) so we copy first 6 character of the key to it's end ("fselkladfklklakl" to "fselkladfklklaklfselkl"). lets check it with a one time pad decipher.
And... yes... here's the flag: FLAGU2JNU1R1X96VOFNKHLB1GEWQ :)
