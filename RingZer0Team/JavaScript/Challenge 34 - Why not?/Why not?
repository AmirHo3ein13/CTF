first of all we should find <script> tag, if we look at it, there's this code:

if(u == "administrator") {
	for(i = 0; i < u.length; i++) {
		if((u.charCodeAt(i) + p.charCodeAt(i) + i * 10) != k[i]) {
			$("#cresponse").html("<div class='alert alert-danger'>Wrong password sorry.</div>");
			t = false;
			break;
		}
	}
}

it's check username and password. in the first if, it checks u whether is equal to "administrator" or not
so we can understand that "administrator" is username.
in the next if, there's a equation (u.charCodeAt(i) + p.charCodeAt(i) + i * 10) != k[i]).
u is "administrator", k is {176,214,205,246,264,255,227,237,242,244,265,270,283}, and p is what we need.
so simply we calculate it and find the charCode of p (you can do it with the code i'd written)and convert it to character and it's the password
after entering username and password it gives us the flag and it is: FLAG-65t23674o6N2NehA44272G24 :)
